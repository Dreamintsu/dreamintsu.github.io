title: "Daily New Word"
draft: false
---

Idea is to fetch a daily new word to learn. 
- Adds to personal list of words. 
- Number of words can be increased
- Automatically generates flashcards using dictionary
	- Make sure that word doesn't link to other word
	- Maybe have flashcard in flashcard?
- Can fetch many words
- Can export into anki cards
- Can export into list that can be imported another place
	- All the database things would have to also be associated with login functionality of my website
- Add more functionality for different languages
	- Maybe start with just a list of words on a txt file
