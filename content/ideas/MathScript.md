Idea for a project: Fast Math script. 

The idea is that many times it is hard to directly find exactly what you need to produce LaTeX math. Produce a fast equation/expression, that can then be called into Wolfram, or LaTeX

First produce a display that shows the expression produced
The idea is that it should only do this well, and do it fast.
(Good since we don't need to evaluate expression or even check for correctness)

- cos -> cos()
- pi -> π
- sum -> Σ
- to undo transformation use DEL
- to do transformation (default), use TAB
	- Don't show pop-ups, user should learn these things
- SS -> integral sign (automatically creates derivative sign)
- __ -> create denominator
- != -> =/=
- lim -> lim
- give user to set up own options as well
