Currently I mostly practice voice, but my time with music has taught me what it means to have dedicated and focused practice. Music for me is a way to connect with others, a way to appreciate culture, and a way to communicate emotion. Most importantly, it's fun to create music with others and share that with the audience!

I'm currently a part of the Pitt Men's Glee Club, and their small group the Pantherhythms. We sing various piecies, in different languages, and in different styles! I currently sing as a baritone, so I get to explore more of the harmonic lines, which is exciting since I usually focus on melodic lines (violin/piano). I hope to learn much more while I'm a part of the group!
